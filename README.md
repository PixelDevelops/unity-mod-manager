# Unity Mod Manager
This is my mod manager for Unity games. It has support for multiple games, and you can even check the console to see which mods are installing properly.

**If the mod(s) you are using get you banned, it is not my responibility, you chose to mod the game anyways.**

## Source code
If you think that I may be able to plant a virus on your computer, the source code is above.

## Extensions
I may add support for extensions to the manager. Somebody could make a live editor, which builds your project and puts it in the BepInEx -> Plugins folder. There are going to be a lot of ideas for extensions out of me.
