# Unity Mod Manager
This is my mod manager for Unity games. It has support for multiple games, and you can even check the console to see which mods are installing properly. The mod manager streamlines the process of installing mods for games that is run on the Unity engine, effectively cutting down on time figuring out how to mod, and increasing on time to play.

**If the mod(s) you are using get you banned, it is not my responibility, you chose to mod the game anyways. By using the software, you agree to the previous statement.**

## Source code
If you think that I may be able to plant a virus on your computer, the source code is above. Of course, you may fork this project from any of it's releases and change it, just make sure to give credit to me.

## Extensions
I may add support for extensions to the manager. Somebody could make a live editor, which builds your project and puts it in the BepInEx -> Plugins folder. There are going to be a lot of ideas for extensions out of me. Hopefully, I will have time to make an acessible API, and if not, I might get some people to fork this project (for security reasons) and help me work on it.

## Pre-releases
I would not advise that you use pre-releases. They are mainly for making checkpoints in the manager, and typically, are used if I'm going somewhere and decide to still work on the project. However, if you do, please be careful, stuff could break. If you encounter an error in any version whether it is a pre-release or not, please make an Issue request on this repository. It helps me keep track of all the bugs I need to fix! :)
